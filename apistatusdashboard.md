# API Services Status Dashboard

*Last Updated: 2025-03-05T22:14:50.912Z*

This dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of all API services and their integration status.

## Status Key

- ðŸŸ¢ **GREEN**: API key securely fetched from credential vault, all security controls implemented, monitoring active
- ðŸŸ¡ **ORANGE**: Implementation exists but has security or connection issues 
- ðŸ”´ **RED**: No secure implementation exists yet

## Green Light Services Documentation

### Core Authentication API (ðŸŸ¢ GREEN)
The Core Authentication API is fully integrated with our secure credential management system. It uses the API_KEY credential stored in `C:\Documents\credentials\myproject\API_KEY`.

#### Implementation Details
**Security Features:**
- API key verification before use
- Request ID tracking for full traceability
- Credential masking in logs
- Suspicious activity monitoring
- Support for both JavaScript and Python implementations

**Endpoints:**
| Endpoint | Method | Description | Authentication |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| /auth/token | POST | Generate authentication token | API Key |
| /auth/verify | GET | Verify authentication token | API Key |
| /auth/refresh | POST | Refresh authentication token | API Key |

### Database Connection Service (ðŸŸ¢ GREEN)
The Database Connection Service is fully integrated with our secure credential management system. It uses the DB_PASSWORD credential stored in `C:\Documents\credentials\myproject\DB_PASSWORD`.

#### Implementation Details
**Security Features:**
- Database password verification before use
- Request ID tracking for full traceability
- Credential masking in logs
- Suspicious activity monitoring

**Connection Details:**
- Connection pool management
- Auto-reconnection on failure
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Transaction support

### Cryptographic Service (ðŸŸ¢ GREEN)
The Cryptographic Service is fully integrated with our secure credential management system. It uses the SECRET_TOKEN credential stored in `C:\Documents\credentials\myproject\SECRET_TOKEN`.

#### Implementation Details
**Security Features:**
- Secret token verification before use
- Request ID tracking for full traceability
- Credential masking in logs
- Suspicious activity monitoring

**Cryptographic Operations:**
- Data encryption/decryption
- Secure hashing
- Digital signatures
- Token generation and validation

## Orange Light Services

### Mail Service (ðŸŸ¡ ORANGE)
This service is currently supported but disconnected due to path configuration issues with credential loading.

**Issues to resolve:**
- Update path configuration to correctly point to `C:\Documents\credentials\myproject\MAIL_API_KEY`
- Implement proper error handling for mail service credential loading
- Add mail service to security monitoring system

### Logging Service (ðŸŸ¡ ORANGE)
This service is implemented but credentials need validation.

**Issues to resolve:**
- Verify format and validity of logging service API credentials
- Implement credential rotation for logging service
- Add proper security tracking for logging credential usage

## Red Light Services (ðŸ”´)

The following services are pending implementation:

1. **Analytics API** - Will provide data analysis capabilities
2. **Payment Gateway** - For processing financial transactions
3. **External Movie Database API** - For fetching movie metadata
4. **User Management Service** - For user profile management
5. **Content Delivery Network** - For optimized content delivery

## Integration Strategy

To move services from Red â†’ Orange â†’ Green status:

### Red to Orange:
1. Create credential files in `C:\Documents\credentials\myproject\`
2. Implement basic service integration
3. Add API connection functions

### Orange to Green:
1. Implement security module integration
2. Add credential verification logic
3. Implement request tracking and monitoring
4. Complete comprehensive testing
5. Document API endpoints and usage

## Credential Security Best Practices

Following GitHub's security recommendations:

1. **Never hardcode authentication credentials** in your code. Store them securely in `C:\Documents\credentials\myproject\`

2. **Use authentication credentials securely:**
   - Use a secret manager like Azure Key Vault or HashiCorp Vault when possible
   - For tokens in scripts, consider using GitHub Actions secrets
   - If using .env files, ensure they are encrypted and never pushed to repositories

3. **Prepare a remediation plan:**
   - Have a process to generate new credentials if compromised
   - Replace compromised credentials everywhere they're stored
   - Delete old compromised credentials

4. **Additional Security Measures:**
   - Limit requests (Throttling) to avoid DDoS/brute-force attacks
   - Use HTTPS on server side to avoid MITM attacks
   - Use HSTS header with SSL to avoid SSL Strip attacks
   - Validate content-type on requests
   - Input validation to prevent XSS, SQL-injection, and other attacks
