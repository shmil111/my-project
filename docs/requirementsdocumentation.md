# Requirements Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements documentation standards and practices for our project. Requirements documentation is crucial for ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what is being built, why it's being built, and how it will function.

## Types of Requirements Documentation

### 1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)

A PRD describes what the product will do, who it is for, and how it addresses user needs. It serves as a foundation for development planning and execution.

### 2. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

An SRS details the specific requirements the software must fulfill, including functional and non-functional requirements, interface requirements, and system features.

## Structure of a Requirements Document

- Project purpose and scope
- Stakeholders
- Definitions and terminology

### 2. Product Description

### 3. Specific Requirements
- Functional requirements
- External interface requirements
- System features
- Non-functional requirements:
  - Performance requirements
  - Safety requirements
  - Security requirements
  - Usability requirements
  - Scalability requirements

### 4. Supporting Information

- Reference documents
- Glossary

## Best Practices for Writing Requirements

### 1. Keep Documentation Up-To-Date
Requirements change throughout the development process. Ensure documentation is regularly updated to reflect the current state of requirements.

### 2. Make Use of Visuals
Include diagrams, screenshots, and other visual aids to illustrate concepts and make the documentation more engaging and easier to understand.

### 3. Use a Consistent Structure and Format
This helps users find the information they need and makes the documentation easier to read and understand.

### 4. Think of the Most Efficient Medium
Consider if text is the best way to convey information, or if audio, video, or other formats might be more effective for certain parts of the documentation.

### 5. Link to Supplementary Information
Insert links to relevant online articles or information pages instead of reproducing them in your documentation.

### 6. Generate Diagrams from Code or Databases
When possible, generate diagrams automatically from code or databases rather than creating them manually.

### 7. Utilize Screenshots and Visuals
Use screenshots to help quickly identify what needs to be updated without having to read the entire text.

### 8. Keep Documentation with Source Code
Store technical documentation together with the source code (but separated) to help keep it updated and easily accessible.

### 9. Customize Access
Give editing permissions to potential authors, while restricting others to view-only access.

### 10. Provide Easy Access for Authors
Ensure authors have quick and easy access to the documentation for reviewing and updating.

### 11. Remember to Back Up
Create regular backups in multiple locations and keep previous versions.

### 12. Use Tags for Easier Searching
Use tags to categorize and label different sections and topics within your documentation.

### Include Environment Setup Where Relevant
In addition to functional and non-functional requirements, ensure your requirements documentation addresses environment configuration when necessary. For example, if your application depends on a specific Azure Resource Group setup or a particular operating system setting, include those requirements clearly. This ensures team members can replicate the environment with minimal confusion.

### 13. Document Azure Integration Requirements
When working with Azure resources, clearly specify:
- Required Azure services (e.g., Resource Groups, VMs, Azure SQL)
- Authentication methods (Service Principal, Managed Identity)
- Access control requirements (RBAC roles)
- Environment configuration details

Example Azure-related requirement:
```markdown
## Requirement ID: AZ-001
- **Type**: Infrastructure
- **Description**: System shall use Azure Resource Group 'prod-rg' in West US region
- **Authentication**: Managed Identity authentication required
- **Access Control**: Contributor role assigned to DevOps team
```

### 14. Include Azure Service Connection Details
For CI/CD pipelines, document required service connections:
```markdown
Azure Service Connection Requirements:
- Connection Name: prod-azure-connection
- Scope Level: Subscription
- Authentication: Service Principal
- Required Permissions: Contributor role on resource group
```

### 15. Implement Secure Authentication
When documenting authentication requirements:
- Use modern protocols (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect)
- Require Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Azure integrations
- Avoid direct protocol implementation unless absolutely necessary
- Prohibit password credential flow (ROPC) except in DevOps scenarios

Example security requirement:
```markdown
## Requirement ID: SEC-001
- **Type**: Security
- **Description**: Authentication must use MSAL library with OAuth 2.0
- **Prohibited**: Direct protocol implementation, password credential flow

```

### 16. Manage Application Credentials
For applications requiring Azure credentials:
- Use certificate credentials instead of client secrets
- Store credentials in Azure Key Vault

### 17. Handle Access Tokens Securely
- Never parse access tokens in client applications
- Use ID tokens for user information
- Validate tokens only in web APIs
- Document token validation requirements

### 18. Document Azure DevOps Service Connections
When integrating with Azure DevOps pipelines:
- Specify required service connection types (Azure Resource Manager, GitHub, etc.)
- Define authentication methods (Service Principal, Managed Identity)
- Document required permissions and scope levels

Example pipeline requirement:
```markdown
## Requirement ID: DEVOPS-001
- **Type**: CI/CD
- **Description**: Azure DevOps service connection to Azure subscription
- **Authentication**: Workload identity federation
- **Scope**: Subscription-level access

```

### 19. Implement Pipeline Security Requirements
- Use workload identity federation instead of secrets
- Restrict pipeline access to specific resources

- Require code reviews for pipeline changes

### 20. Define Azure Key Vault Requirements
When implementing Azure Key Vault for secret management:
- Specify vault-per-environment isolation requirements (dev, test, prod)
- Document purge protection and soft-delete configuration
- Define secret rotation schedules and automation
- Specify monitoring and logging requirements
- Document network access restrictions (Private Link, firewall rules)

Example Key Vault requirement:
```markdown
## Requirement ID: KEYVAULT-001

- **Configuration**:
  - Soft-delete: Enabled with 90-day retention
  - Purge protection: Enabled
  - Network access: Restricted to application subnet
  - Monitoring: Azure Monitor alerts for access failures
- **Secret rotation**: Automated quarterly rotation required
- **Access model**: RBAC with PIM for administrative access
```

### 21. Implement Secret Caching Requirements
For applications accessing Azure Key Vault:
- Document client-side caching requirements (minimum 8 hours recommended)
- Specify retry policies with exponential backoff
- Define secret access patterns to minimize throttling
- Document fallback mechanisms for service unavailability

Example caching requirement:
```markdown
## Requirement ID: KEYVAULT-002
- **Type**: Performance

For applications processing personal data of EU residents:
- Document lawful basis for data processing
- Define data minimization requirements
- Specify data retention periods
- Document data subject rights implementation
- Define breach notification procedures
- Specify requirements for Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA)

Example GDPR requirement:
```markdown
## Requirement ID: GDPR-001

- **Description**: Application must implement GDPR compliance measures
- **Lawful basis**: Document legal justification for all data processing
- **Data minimization**: Collect only necessary personal data
- **Retention**: Define maximum retention periods for each data category
- **Subject rights**: Implement mechanisms for access, rectification, erasure
- **Breach notification**: Process to notify authorities within 72 hours
- **Privacy by design**: Document DPIA requirements for high-risk processing
```

### 24. Implement Compliance Traceability
For regulatory compliance tracking:
- Document mapping between requirements and implementation
